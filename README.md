Collection of scripts and code examples for pulling out bulk data from Understat. These scripts use the Python package Understant. For more detail on the package you can visit the github ![here](https://github.com/amosbastian/understat)

Full disclaimer: I am not in anyway involved with the understat website or Python package Understat. Full credit for the package must go to Amos Bastian, this repo are just some code examples and scripts I've wrote for data I often need to pull from understat that I'm making available on Github. I may end up building these into a command line utility at somepoint but for now that's a long way off.





Need to expand matches data to pulling out shots and players
